    Three samples are required to reconstruct a quadratic signal (i.e., to find its coefficients). 
    Unless the quadratic function is sparse (has only one nonzero coefficient) and we apply Compressive Sensing.

    This example requires just 5 lines of new code (and editing a few lines of
    auto-generated code). Follow along and, in just a few moments, you can use this 
    blab as a template for your own work.

    <p>
    A soliton is a pulse that experiences both nonlinearity and
    dispersion. Nonlinearity 
    sharpens the pulse&mdash;taller parts travel faster than shorter parts 
    (like a wave breaking on a beach). Dispersion spreads it out&mdash;different 
    frequencies travel at different speeds. With a soliton the sharpening and 
    spreading balance <i>exactly</i> (and the balance is stable!).

    Although we can never visit the interior of a far-off planet, we
    can use the observed mass and radius of the planet, plus some
    assumptions about what is inside (rock, water, ice, gas, etc) to
    create a plausible model of the interior of the planet.

    <p>
    Mars is actually a very simple body. It is round, it spins, and it
    has mass.  Although we can't visit the interior of Mars, or any
    other planet for that matter, there are ways that we can explore a
    planet's interior just by knowing a few basic things about it as a
    planet.  In this lab, you will create a model of the interior of
    Mars by knowing three basic things about its bulk properties.
